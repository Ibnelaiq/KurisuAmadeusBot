This is a Discord AI chatbot that uses the [Microsoft DialoGPT conversational model](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/DialoGPT-medium) fine-tuned on the script of [Makise Kurisu](https://steins-gate.fandom.com/wiki/Kurisu_Makise) from Visual Novel [Steins;Gate](https://store.steampowered.com/app/412830/STEINSGATE/). The responses dataset is included in the [Makise Kurisu's Responses in Steins Gate VN](https://github.com/Ibnelaiq/KurisuQA).

The chatbot is built using JavaScript and is deployed with a Flask backend [explore more.](https://github.com/Ibnelaiq/KurisuAmadeusBot-AI)  It classifies user inputs and generates responses from the trained model as requested. Special thanks to the guide ["Build a Discord AI Chatbot that Speaks like Your Favorite Character!"](https://github.com/RuolinZheng08/twewy-discord-chatbot) for the inspiration.

Note that the script from [Anime Steins;Gate](https://myanimelist.net/anime/9253/Steins_Gate) isn't included in dataset yet.
